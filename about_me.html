          Hello, I'm Nathalie Grace P. Poticar, a self-taught artist. My artistic journey began during the challenging times of the 2019 pandemic when I discovered the therapeutic power of art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interestingly, creativity runs in my family, and my father, too, is good in art. Drawing inspiration from his talent, I embarked on my own artistic exploration, dedicating myself to of charcoal drawing.
        </p>
        <p>
          My preferred medium, charcoal, allows me to capture the subtle nuances of light and shadow, creating evocative and expressive pieces.However, I still need to enhance my charcoal drawing skills to achieve a more realistic results. Additionally, I delve into the digital art,it was 2019 when I also started digital drawing, utilizing Clip Studio Paint to bring my ideas to life with a contemporary twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my personal artistic pursuits, I contribute to the creative landscape of our school as a cartoonist in the publication office. This role has not only refined my skills but also allowed me to connect with the vibrant artistic community within the school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join me on this artistic journey as I continue to explore the intersection of traditional and digital art, always seeking new ways to express my creativity and share my unique perspective with the world.
